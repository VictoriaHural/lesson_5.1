					a
					single snowflake and was central to the showpiece from beginning to the end of the Ceremony. The theme
					was
					based on an ancient Chinese saying which meant that "a truly wise person sees the whole world as a
					family".</p>

			A virtual ice cube breaks apart, revealing crystals in the shape of the five interlaced Olympic Rings. At past
			Opening Ceremonies, the iconic rings have been formed with fire, wood, snow, and even performers. “The Olympic
			symbol expresses the activity of the Olympic Movement and represents the union of the five continents and the
			meeting of athletes from throughout the world at the Olympic Games.”

			seven torchbearers carried six torches – representing Chinese winter sports athletes across six generations.
			The last two torchbearers, <span>Zhao Jiawen</span> and <span>Dinigeer Yilamujiang</span>, both born in the
			2000s, brought the spectacle
			to a close when they lit the cauldron, which was placed in the middle of a giant snowflake. The giant snowflake
			comprises individual snowflakes representing the 91 nations and regions taking part in Beijing 2022.
